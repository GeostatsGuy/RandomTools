    "### The Interactive Image Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple workflow on for visualization of wheel/tire fit on my jeep.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* I made this to help me choose the wheel and tire combination for an online order\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vehicle Wheel and Tire Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of considerations and parameters for wheel and tire selection. Concerns include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **astetic**: the look of the wheel and tire combination with the vehicle body and suspension configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **fit**: the operation of the vehicle without contact between the wheel and tire and the vehicle suspension components and body (fenders)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **legal requirements**: some states require wheels to be covered by fenders for safety to limit thrown rocks etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this application is an approximation and is designed for visualization and a first pass evaluation of astetic only. There are no guarantee of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "* this app was designed by fitting my current wheel and tire specs to my images and then scaling, translating with any modifications to my current set up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* distances were appoximated with landmarks identified and measured on the jeep\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wheel and Tire Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime I modify my jeep there is a learning curve.  For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "* when my kids and I installed a light bar we learned about lighting, wiring, switches, power requirements and relays. \n",
    "\n",
    "* when we installed a winch and bumper we learned about torque wrenches, wiring, cable options, methods for self rescue and using brute force to attach large, heavy metal!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of concepts required to select tires. Here's the parameters with brief explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **wheel diameter** - the diameter of the wheel measured in inches.  Common sizes are from 16 to 19 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **wheel width** - the height of the wheel cylinder measured in inches.  Commonly wheels are reported by diameter x width.  e.g. 17x8.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **wheel offset** - the distance from the midpoint of the wheel to the mount measured in millimeters.  + indicates the wheels are pulled under the car and - indicates the wheels are pushed out from under the car.  e.g. extreme - offset results in wheels exceeding (sticking out from) the vehicle fenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **tire width** - the width measured at the thickest part of the wheel measured in millimeters.  Common sizes are 235 to 275. e.g. for a tire code 255/75R18, the tire width is 255 mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **tire aspect ratio** - the height to width ratio of the tire.  Common sizes are 55 to 85. e.g. for a tire code 255/75R18, the tire aspect ratio is 0.75, the height is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the tire width.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **lift** - the suspension lift on the vehicle measure in inches. Through modification or replacement of suspension components the clearance between wheel and vehicle body is increased.  Common vehicle lifts are 1 to 4 inches.  The original equipment (OE) state is 0 inch lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various sources available with more infomration on wheels and tires, e.g. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_sizing). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "I teach data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning. This is an opportunity to demonstrate the design of an interactive image in Python to communicate complicated concepts to support decision making, e.g. buying wheels and tires!  \n",
    "\n",
    "* create demonstration to support and motivate education through fun experiential learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* talk about Jeeps!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda 3 on your machine (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). \n",
    "2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. \n",
    "3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. \n",
    "4. Open Jupyter and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tabular data - sample_data.csv at https://git.io/fh4gm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code loads the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* we will need some standard packages. These should have been installed with Anaconda 3."

    "#### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a basic demonstration of Jeep wheel / tire fitting with interactive editing of images in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the ability to build interactive displays like this can help you communicate, teach concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* tire / wheel fitting was fun, but this could be used to communicate while utilizing complicated images/maps that you could not hand draw/calculate in matplotlib (e.g. intepreted maps, output from a physics model that you do not have the original data).\n",
    "\n",
    "* data science is all about communication to impact decision making, even the choice of jeep modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a basic demonstration of vairogram modeling for spatial continuity analysis. Much more could be done, I have other demonstrations on the basics of working with DataFrames, ndarrays, univariate statistics, plotting data, declustering, data transformations and many other workflows available at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos and https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy. \n",
